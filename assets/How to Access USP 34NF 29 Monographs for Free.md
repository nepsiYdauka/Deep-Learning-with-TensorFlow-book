One of the older editions that may be of interest is USP 34âNF 29, which was official from May 1, 2011 to April 30, 2012. This edition contained over 4,000 monographs and over 300 general chapters. Some of the notable changes in this edition were the introduction of new monographs for biologics and biosimilars, the revision of monographs for heparin and low molecular weight heparins, and the harmonization of monographs with international pharmacopeias.
 
If you are looking for a way to access USP 34âNF 29 monographs for free, you have a few options.
